## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Demonstration
This app is intended to illustrate how you can add relevant knowledge to an otherwise basic LLM Chat.  

Find a PDF with some information in it that an LLM wouldn't normally have. 
Before uploading the PDF, ask a question about some of the contents of the PDF.
Upload the PDF and ask the same question again.  With the new context, the LLM can give more informed answers.
